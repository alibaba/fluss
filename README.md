## What is Fluss?

Fluss is a streaming storage built for real-time analytics which can serve as the real-time data layer for Lakehouse architectures.

It bridges the gap between **data streaming** and **data Lakehouse** by enabling low-latency, high-throughput data ingestion and processing while seamlessly integrating with popular compute engines like **Apache Flink**, while Apache Spark, and StarRocks are coming soon.

**Fluss (German: river, pronounced `/flus/`)** enables streaming data continuously converging, distributing and flowing into lakes, like a river ðŸŒŠ

## Building

Prerequisites for building Fluss:

- Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
