Fluss
----

Fluss is a streaming storage built for real-time analytics which can serve as the real-time data layer
for Lakehouse architectures. With its columnar stream and real-time update capabilities,
Fluss integrates seamlessly with Apache Flink to enable high-throughput, low-latency, cost-effective
streaming data warehouses tailored for real-time applications.

The Fluss project, named after the German word for 'river' and pronounced `/flus/`,
symbolizes the essence of streaming data continuously flowing, converging, and distributing like a river.
