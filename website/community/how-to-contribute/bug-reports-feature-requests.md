# Bug reports and feature requests

You can report an issue in the [Fluss issue tracker](https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/issues).

## Issue Reporting Guide

Considerations before opening an issue:

- Make sure that the issue corresponds to a genuine bug or enhancement request. Exceptions are made for typos in documentation files, which can be reported directly.

- Name the issue in the format "[component] Title of the issue", where *[component]* should be replaced by the name of the component being affected. Typically, this corresponds to areas like [server], [client], [connector], [docs]. Skip *[component]* if you are unsure about which is the best component.

- Fill out the issue template to describe the problem or enhancement clearly. Please describe it such that maintainers understand the context and impact from the description, not only from reproduction steps.

- Make sure that you have searched existing issues to avoid duplicates.

- Each issue should address only one problem or enhancement, not mix up multiple unrelated topics.

## Looking for what to report

## How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?

**Steps to reproduce:**
3. What did you do?

**Expected vs Actual behavior:**
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Troubleshooting questions should be posted on:

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Fluss aims to provide a unified streaming storage for real-time analytics, offering seamless data ingestion, processing, and querying capabilities with strong consistency guarantees and efficient storage management.

If you're looking for a feature that doesn't exist in Fluss, you're probably not alone. Others likely have similar needs. Please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/alibaba/fluss/issues/new) describing the feature you'd like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

When creating your feature request, document your requirements first. Please, try to not directly describe the solution.
